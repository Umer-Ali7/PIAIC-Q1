# üìò Class 02 ‚Äì Installing n8n Locally with Node.js  

**Date:** Sunday, August 24, 2025  
**Instructors:** Sir Aneeq & Sir Hamza  
**Tools Used:** Node.js, n8n  

---

## üéØ Objective  
In this class, we learned how to **install and run n8n locally** using **Node.js + npm**. This setup allows us to build automation workflows directly from our own system without using the cloud version.  

---

## ‚ö° Steps We Followed  

1. **Install Node.js**  
   - Downloaded Node.js (LTS version) from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).  
   - Verified installation:  
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```

2. **Install n8n Globally**  
   - Used npm to install n8n:  
     ```bash
     npm install n8n -g
     ```

3. **Run n8n Locally**  
   - Start the n8n editor with:  
     ```bash
     n8n
     ```
   - Open browser and go to:  
     [http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678)

## üõ†Ô∏è Why Local Installation?  
- Full control over workflows.  
- No internet dependency for basic testing.  
- Useful for **offline practice**.  
- Prepares system for **advanced automations** (Google Sheets, Airtable, AI models, etc.).  

---

## üîÆ Coming Next  
- Connecting n8n with external apps (e.g., Airtable, Google Sheets).  
- Creating automated workflows with real data.  
- Adding **AI-powered nodes** inside workflows.

‚ú® *This class gave us the foundation to run n8n locally and start building our own automation workflows.*
