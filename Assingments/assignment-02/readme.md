---

## 🔹 Q1: Variables & Data Types
- Created variables with `str`, `int`, and `bool` data types.
- Printed variable values and their respective data types.

---

## 🔹 Q2: Arithmetic Operators
- Performed basic arithmetic operations:  
  `+ (Addition)`, `- (Subtraction)`, `* (Multiplication)`, `/ (Division)`, `// (Floor Division)`, `% (Modulus)`, `** (Exponentiation)`

---

## 🔹 Q3: Assignment Operators
- Initialized a variable `num = 10`.
- Applied assignment operators step by step:  
  - `+=` (add 5)  
  - `*=` (multiply by 2)  
  - `-=` (subtract 4)  
- Printed the final value of `num`.

---

## 🔹 Q4: Comparison Operators
- Declared two integers `a = 15` and `b = 12`.
- Performed comparison operations:  
  `>`, `<`, `==`, `!=`, `>=`, `<=`

---

## 🔹 Q5: Logical Operators
- Used boolean values `p = True` and `q = False`.
- Performed logical operations:  
  `and`, `or`, `not`

---

## 🔹 Q6: Real-life Example
- Defined the price and quantity of notebooks.  
- Calculated the total cost.  
- Checked whether the available cash was enough to purchase the notebooks.

---

## 🔹 Q7: Bonus (Optional)
- Took two numbers as user input.  
- Calculated their sum.  
- Compared both numbers to check if the first one is greater than the second.
