## 🤖 Types of AI Discussed
- **Predictive AI** → Uses data to predict outcomes (e.g., targeted ads).  
- **Generative AI** → Creates new content (text, images, plans, etc.).  
- **Agentic AI** → Takes actions on behalf of users (bookings, posts, workflows).  

---

## 🐍 Python – First Steps
- Installed Python & verified version.  
- Entered REPL and printed first program:  
  ```python
  print("Hello World") -->
